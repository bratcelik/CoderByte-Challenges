/*
* Additive Persistence

* Have the function AdditivePersistence(num) take the num parameter being passed
* which will always be a positive integer and return its additive persistence
* which is the number of times you must add the digits in num until you reach a single digit.
* For example:
* if num is 2718 then your program should return 2 because 2 + 7 + 1 + 8 = 18 and 1 + 8 = 9 and you stop at 9.
*
* Examples:
*
* Input: 4
* Output: 0
*
* Input: 19
* Output: 2
